# Arcane Wallpaper Packs
The installation will come with various wallpapers out of the box. Since I"m not always into the same thing, and my tastes are always changing throughout the year, I hope that all of these wallpaper packs will satisfy that.

All of these wallpapers will be rendered in 4K in .PNG to conserve the best quality possible. However, with that in mind, there will be a separate 4K, 2K, 1080p PNG and JPG variants if you want something lighter.
